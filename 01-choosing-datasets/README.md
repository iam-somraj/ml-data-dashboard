# Choosing Datasets

Choose a dataset (e.g., COVID-19 data, stock market data, etc)


## Installation

If they are not in your system

```bash
  pip install pandas
```
```bash
  pip install matplotlib
```
    
## Roadmap

- Download the "daily-data.csv" (put it inside a folder) & create a file main.py

- Either copy paste directly from main.py or download the whole folder

- Make sure matplotlib & pandas are in your system

- Simply run the file, make the daily-data.csv file location is mentioned clearly.
